"September"<br />
<br />
Do you remember the<br />
21st night of September?<br />
Love was changing the minds of pretenders<br />
While chasing the clouds away<br />
<br />
Our hearts were ringing<br />
In the key that our souls were singing.<br />
As we danced in the night,<br />
Remember how the stars stole the night away<br />
<br />
Ba de ya - say do you remember<br />
Ba de ya - dancing in September<br />
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day<br />
<br />
Ba duda, ba duda, ba duda, badu<br />
Ba duda, badu, ba duda, badu<br />
Ba duda, badu, ba duda<br />
<br />
My thoughts are with you<br />
Holding hands with your heart to see you<br />
Only blue talk and love,<br />
Remember how we knew love was here to stay<br />
<br />
Now December found the love we shared in September.<br />
Only blue talk and love,<br />
Remember the true love we share today<br />
<br />
