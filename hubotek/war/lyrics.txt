"Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be"<br />
<br />
Sometimes I think this woman is kinda hot<br />
Sometimes I think this woman is sometimes not<br />
Puts me down<br />
Fool me around<br />
Why she do it to me<br />
Out for satisfaction<br />
Any piece of action<br />
That ain't the way it should be<br />
She needs lovin'<br />
Knows I'm the man<br />
She' gotta see<br />
Pours my beer<br />
Licks my ear<br />
Brings out the devil in me<br />
Hell ain't a bad place to be<br />
<br />
Spends my money<br />
Drinks my booze<br />
Stays out every night<br />
But I got to thinkin'<br />
Hey, just a minute<br />
Somethin' ain't right<br />
Disillusions and confusion<br />
Make me wanna cry<br />
The shame you<br />
Playin' your games<br />
Tellin' me those lies<br />
Don't mind her playin' demon<br />
As long as it's with me<br />
If this is hell<br />
Then let me say<br />
It's heavenly<br />
Hell ain't a bad place to be<br />
<br />
Late at night<br />
Turns down the light<br />
Closes up on me<br />
Opens my heart<br />
Tears me apart<br />
Brings out the devil in me<br />
<br />
Hell ain't a bad place to be<br />
I said<br />
Hell ain't a bad place to be<br />
Hell<br />
Ain't a bad place to be<br />
Hell<br />
Ain't a bad place to be
