"Metal Gods"</br>
</br>
[Tipton/Halford/Downing]</br>
</br>
We've taken too much for granted</br>
And all the time it had grown</br>
From techno seeds we first planted</br>
Evolved a mind of its own</br>
</br>
Marching in the streets</br>
Dragging iron feet</br>
Laser beaming hearts</br>
Ripping men apart</br>
</br>
From off I've seen my perfection</br>
Where we could do as we please</br>
In secrecy this infection</br>
Was spreading like a disease</br>
</br>
Hiding underground</br>
Knowing we'd be found</br>
Fearing for our lives</br>
Reaped by robot's scythes</br>
</br>
Metal Gods</br>
Metal Gods</br>

Metal Gods</br>
Metal Gods</br>
</br>
Machines are taking all over</br>
With mankind in their command</br>
In time they'd like to discover</br>
How they can make their demand</br>
</br>
Better be the slaves</br>
To their wicked ways</br>
But meeting with our death</br>
Engulfed in molten breath
